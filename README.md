A bot to render state graphs on discord! This bot uses [PyFSA](https://github.com/taliamax/pyfsa) as a backend to render the graphs from the input.

This bot uses space-separated CSV blocks to organize the state machine and properly label the transitions. This means that you can write state machines purely in discord, and have them join the discussion. No more having to install a CLI and figure out dependencies!


Some example usage:

```
$state "a,x,y b,x,z a,y,x b,y,z b,y,z a,z,z b,z,z"
```

You can also pass all options supported by the CLI to the command as well, which will let you set things such as the start node, end node, and even layout engine. This is done with key-value pairs, separated by an equal sign

```
$state "a,x,y b,x,z a,y,x b,y,z b,y,z a,z,z b,z,z" start=x end=z engine=dot
```

Keep in mind, if you need to separate data by spaces, you'll need to wrap the whole term in quotation marks.


This bot also supports rendering walk-throughs of state graphs with specific strings. For those, you'll need to specify the start state, the end state, and the string, as well as the state transitions. Here's an example:

```
$string "states=a,x,y b,x,z a,y,x b,y,z b,y,z a,z,z b,z,z" start=x end=z string=aaaba
```

If the string is valid in that state machine, the final node of the resulting graph will be green.
